# Used-Car-Value-Analyzer

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict the prices of used cars. We use various regression algorithms such as Decision Tree, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest to build our predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Name**: The name of the car
- **Location**: The location where the car is being sold
- **Year**: The year the car was purchased
- **Kilometers_Driven**: The distance driven by the car in kilometers
- **Fuel_Type**: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
- **Transmission**: The type of transmission (Automatic/Manual)
- **Owner_Type**: The type of ownership (First owner, Second owner, etc.)
- **Mileage**: The mileage of the car (in kmpl or km/kg)
- **Engine**: The engine capacity (in CC)
- **Power**: The power of the car (in bhp)
- **Seats**: The number of seats in the car
- **New_Price**: The price of the car when it was new
- **Price**: The current price of the car (target variable)

## Models Used

We have implemented and compared the following machine learning algorithms:

- **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model used to make decisions based on the input features.
- **Linear Regression**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
